# Excel VBA MIDI Music Project

This project demonstrates how to play musical scales using VBA.

## Setup

Add the MIDI and note class to a VBA project.

The MIDI class encapsulates all the low level Windows MIDI calls.

The Note class handles the logic for playing notes.

To make use of the MIDI funcionality, new code should interact with the Note class only.

A demonstration is included that plays a C Major scale.
